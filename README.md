# Implement-the-perceptron-learning-algorithm-



: Implement the perceptron learning algorithm to classify 3-dimensional points into two classes based on a given dataset. Update weights iteratively until convergence.
: Develop a Python program to determine the number of linearly separable binary classification problems from a given dataset of 3-dimensional points. Validate using multiple class combinations.
: Analyze the convergence of the perceptron learning algorithm by varying the learning rate and epochs. Evaluate its impact on classification accuracy.
